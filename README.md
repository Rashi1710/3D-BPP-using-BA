The Bees Algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm that attempts to find a feasible solution out of all the possible solution of an optimization problem in polynomial time instead of the absolute best solution in exponential time.
It is a Swarm Intelligence Algorithm that mimics the food foraging behaviour of honey bees colonies.
It can be used for both combinatorial as well for continuous optimization problems.
3D Bin Packing is a Combinatorial Optimization Problem that is strongly NP-hard. 
It involves packing items of different dimensions with most efficient orientation in the least number of bins.
3D BPP aims to pack a given set of cuboidal items (having different dimensions (d,w,h)) into a minimum number of identical cuboidal bins (having dimensions (D,W,H)) with no overlapping.

The EMS and DFTRC-2 approach we have used was first introduced by Goncalves et al., 2013.

This is the first application of the Bees Algorithm to 3D BPP.

We have built our solution upon the paper on the usage of BA for 1D BPP by Hartono et al., 2022.
